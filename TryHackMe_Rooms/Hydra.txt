# Room: Hydra (Brute‑force Tooling Basics)

# Goal: 
Learn Hydra syntax and safe usage for online password attempts in a lab.  
Key Skills: Wordlists, service targets (SSH/FTP/HTTP‑form), rate control, legal/ethical limits.

# Method (High‑Level)
1. Target Selection: Identify service and username(s).  
2. Command Structure: Choose module (e.g., ssh/ftp/http‑form), specify `-l/-L` (user) and `-p/-P` (pass), set request format for forms.  
3. Controls: Limit speed/threads; avoid lockouts; stop on success; log output.  
4. Validation: Confirm credentials and capture the lab flag.

# Defensive Takeaways
- MFA, account lockout policies, monitoring failed‑login patterns, WAF/Fail2ban, strong passwords.
