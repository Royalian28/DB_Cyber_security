# TryHackMe Room: Pyramid of Pain

* Room Type: Defensive Security Concept
* Objective: Understand the Pyramid of Pain model and how hard it is for attackers to change different indicators of compromise (IoCs).
* Tasks Completed

  1. Introduction → Learned what the Pyramid of Pain is.
  2. Hash Values (Trivial) → Simple to change, defenders don’t rely only on them.
  3. IP Addresses (Easy) → Attackers can switch quickly using proxies/VPNs.
  4. Domain Names (Simple) → Easy for attackers to rotate domains with automation.
  5. Network/Host Artifacts → Harder for adversaries to change because tied to tools/tactics.
  6. Tools / TTPs (Hard/Costly) → The higher we go in the pyramid, the more difficult it is for adversaries to adapt.
* Key Learning: Effective defense means focusing on higher-level indicators (TTPs) rather than just hashes or IPs.
