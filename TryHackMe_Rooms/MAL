📝 Tasks Completed

Introduction to Malware

Learned what malware is and the different categories (worms, trojans, ransomware, spyware, rootkits).

Malware Components

Explored payloads, persistence mechanisms, obfuscation, and delivery methods.

Understood how attackers hide their code to evade detection.

APT Lifecycle

Studied how Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) move through the kill chain: Initial Access → Execution → Persistence → Privilege Escalation → Defense Evasion → C2 communication.

Hands-On with Tools

VirusTotal → Used to check file hashes and scan for known malware.

Hybrid Analysis / Joe Sandbox → Viewed sandbox reports to see dynamic behavior.

strings & hexdump → Learned to extract readable text from binaries for quick IoC hunting.

Identifying Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

Learned how file hashes, IPs, domains, and registry changes serve as IoCs.

Saw how these indicators help track malware campaigns.

🎯 Key Learning

Malware is more than just “viruses”—it’s a whole ecosystem of techniques.

Static and dynamic analysis are essential first steps to investigate suspicious files.

Recognizing IoCs is crucial for incident response and proactive defense.
