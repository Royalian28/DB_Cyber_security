# Room: Blue (MS17‑010 / “EternalBlue”)

# Goal: 
Identify and exploit SMBv1 MS17‑010 on a Windows host within the THM network.  
Key Skills: SMB enumeration, vulnerability validation, careful exploitation, Windows post‑exploitation.

# Method (High‑Level)
1. Recon: Version/service detection on SMB; check for MS17‑010 signatures (safe NSE scripts / framework checks).  
2. Confirm: Verify the host is actually vulnerable (SMBv1 and the MS17‑010 fingerprint).  
3. Exploit (lab context): Use a controlled module to get a shell; stabilize session.  
4. Post‑Exploitation: Collect flags with least impact, then clean up.

# Defensive Takeaways
- Disable SMBv1, apply MS17‑010 patches, enable network segmentation and logging on 445.
