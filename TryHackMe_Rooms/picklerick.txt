# TryHackMe Room: Pickle Rick

* **Room Type:** Offensive Security / CTF
* **Objective:** Collect the three secret ingredients hidden in the target system.


# Tasks Completed

1. **Reconnaissance**

   * Pinged target to verify it was live.
   * Nmap scan revealed **22 (SSH)** and **80 (HTTP)** open.

2. **Web Enumeration**

   * Explored the HTTP service and page source → found a **username**.
   * Checked `robots.txt` → revealed a **password clue**.
   * Ran Gobuster → discovered hidden login page `portal.php`.

3. **Initial Access**

   * Logged into the portal with discovered credentials.
   * Gained access to a restricted **command panel** for system interaction.

4. **Privilege Escalation**

   * Verified commands worked (`ls`, `less`).
   * Used `sudo -l` → confirmed root access was possible.
   * Switched to root and escalated privileges.

5. **Capture the Ingredients**

   * Navigated directories with root privileges.
   * Retrieved all three hidden ingredients, completing the challenge.


# Key Learning

This room reinforced practical skills in **web enumeration, directory brute-forcing, privilege escalation, and restricted shell bypass techniques**. It showed the importance of persistence and creativity when facing limited command environments.
