# Room: Further Nmap

# Goal: 
Move beyond basic scans to aggressive detection and NSE usage.  
Key Skills: Timing templates, script scans, targeted port ranges, output formats.

# Method (High‑Level)
1. Baselines: Default scripts and version scan to build service inventory.  
2. Aggressive Mode: OS detection + traceroute as appropriate in a lab; be mindful of noise.  
3. NSE: Use safe scripts for service enumeration and vuln checks; export results in multiple formats for reporting.  
4. Validation: Re‑scan changed services; diff outputs.

# Defensive Takeaways
- Service inventory accuracy, change management, and alerting on unexpected open ports.
