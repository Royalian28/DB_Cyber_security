Room: Blaster

Target/OS: Windows

Goal: Gain initial access, escalate privileges, capture flags.

Recon:
Nmap shows open ports: 80 (IIS), 135 (RPC), 139/445 (SMB).
Web server hosts a site with default pages, discovered hidden directory with credentials leak.

Exploit Path (high-level):
Use weak service credentials to log in via RDP.
Exploit privilege escalation via misconfigured scheduled task.

Post-Exploitation: Retrieved user.txt and root.txt.

Cleanup: Clear event logs, remove created accounts.

Defensive Notes: Patch privilege escalation paths, restrict SMB shares, enforce strong passwords.
