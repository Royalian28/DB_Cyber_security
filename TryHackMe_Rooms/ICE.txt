# Room: Ice (Windows / Icecast)

# Goal: 
Gain foothold on a Windows host running Icecast and escalate to retrieve flags.  
Key Skills: Service enumeration, Windows exploitation, post‑exploitation hygiene.

# Method (High‑Level)
1. Recon: Full TCP scan and service/version detection to identify Icecast on TCP/8000; note Windows services (SMB/RDP/etc.).  
2. Vuln ID: Icecast 2.0.1 is historically vulnerable to a buffer overflow (CVE linked in public writeups).  
3. Exploit (lab context): Use a vetted framework module for Icecast overflow to obtain a reverse shell. Avoid real‑world targets.  
4. Post‑Exploitation: Enumerate user context, collect allowed flags, and tidy up artifacts.

# Defensive Takeaways
- Retire/patch Icecast 2.0.1; implement allow‑listing and EDR; restrict exposed services.
