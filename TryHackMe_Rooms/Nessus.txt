# Room: RP — Nessus Redux

# Goal: 
Install and operate Nessus to perform authenticated/unauthenticated scans and interpret reports.  
Key Skills: Policy templates, scan scoping, credentialed scans, false‑positive review.

# Method (High‑Level)
1. Setup: Install Nessus, register, and update plugins.  
2. Scoping: Create a scan policy; set targets, ports, performance, and safe checks.  
3. Execution: Run scan, monitor runtime; export results (HTML, CSV).  
4. Analysis: Prioritize by CVSS, proof of exploitability, business context; retest after remediation.

# Defensive Takeaways
- Scheduled scanning, differential reports, ticketing integration, and validating critical findings.
