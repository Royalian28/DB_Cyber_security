Room Type: Pre-Security (Networking Foundations)

Objective: Deep dive into DNS and its importance in networking & security.

Tasks Completed:

DNS Basics → Learned how DNS translates domain names to IP addresses.
DNS Records → A (Address), CNAME, MX, TXT, PTR — their uses in internet communication.
How DNS Works → Recursive and iterative queries explained.
Security Context → Learned how attackers abuse DNS (DNS hijacking, tunneling, exfiltration).
Key Learning: DNS is both a backbone of the internet and a frequent target for attackers; defenders must monitor DNS traffic for anomalies.
